    <h2>story of my life</h2>

    <p>
      i was born and i went to china to visit grandparents, then i came back and
      have a good active childhood with lots of moving around and stuff that has
      to do with talking with random strangers in parks and stuff. after that my
      parents found a better job and so i moved to staten island and became less
      social. i passed elementry school and went into middle school, it was then
      that i discovered books and i started to read them to pass the time. after
      a year of that i discovered anime and i watched some of the weirdest
      things in my life. and basically like that i passed through middle school.
      in the year before the first covid i also got a computer and i got into
      games. during covid i got tired of the inefficient speed at which i
      consumed media and so i decided to read the anime stories at their source
      and went to read the translated webnovels which is all i do now
    </p>

    <h3>some webnovels that i liked</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>lord of the mysteries</li>
      <li>i'm really not the demon god's lackey</li>
      <li>the demon prince goes to the academy</li>
      <li>omnicient reader viewpoint</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>top 5 story tropes that i dislike (off the top of my head)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the mc(main character) are stated to be thousands of years old and still
        act like 16 years old hormonal teenager

        direction
